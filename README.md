# Data_projects_TripleTen
Projects I worked on while attending the Data Science TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | [IMBd Ratings](https://github.com/mattfuller2/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/01_IMDb%20Ratings) | The project task aims to analyze the relationship between show ratings and the number of votes. |
| 2 | [Instacart Customer Behavior Analysis (EDA)](https://github.com/mattfuller2/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/02_Instacart_Customer_Behavior_Analysis) | The project task was to prepare a report that gives insight into the shopping habits of Instacart customers. |
| 3 | [Mobile Plan Revenue Analysis (SDA)](https://github.com/mattfuller2/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/03_Mobile_Plan_Revenue_Analysis) | This project is focused on analyzing and comparing the revenue generated by two mobile phone plans: Surf and Ultimate. |
| 4 | Car Sales Advertisements (Software Development Tools) | The project task was to develop and deploy a web application to a cloud service so that it is accessible to the public. |
| 5 | [Video Game Sales Analysis (Integrated Project)](https://github.com/mattfuller2/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/05_Video_Game_Sales) | This project focuses on analyzing video game sales and user ratings across various platforms, genres, and regions in North America, Europe, and Japan. |
| 6 | Taxi Data Analysis and Hypothesis Testing (SQL) | In this project, we are performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and testing a hypothesis using three datasets related to taxi rides in Chicago to understand patterns in the data, create insightful visualizations, and test a specific hypothesis related to ride durations. |
| 7 | Predicting Mobile Plan Selection for Megaline (Machine Learning) | The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict which of Megaline's two modern plans—Smart or Ultra—a customer is most likely to choose based on their usage behavior. |
| 8 | Beta Bank Customer Churn Prediction (Supervised Learning) | The objective of this project is to build a supervised learning model with the maximum possible F1 score to predict customer churn. |
| 9 | OilyGiant Oil Well Prediction Project (Machine Learning) | This project is aimed at helping the OilyGiant mining company determine the best location for a new oil well. |
| 10 | Gold Recovery Data Analysis (Integrated Project) | This project focuses on analyzing and modeling the processes involved in the recovery of gold from ore. Using a dataset that captures the characteristics of the materials at various purification stages, the goal is to understand how the concentrations of metals like Gold, Silver, and Lead change, and how this affects the overall efficiency of the gold recovery process. |
| 11 | Sure Tomorrow Insurance Prediction (Linear Algebra) | This project is aimed at helping the "Sure Tomorrow" insurance company solve multiple business problems using machine learning techniques. The tasks include predicting customer similarity, insurance benefit likelihood, and obfuscating personal data without affecting model performance. |
| 12 | Rusty Bargain Used Car Price Prediction (Numerical Methods) | This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the market value of used cars for the Rusty Bargain used car sales service. The company aims to develop an app that allows customers to quickly estimate the value of their vehicles based on historical data, including technical specifications, trim versions, and prices. |
| 13 | Sweet Lift Taxi: Taxi Order Prediction (Time Series) | The Sweet Lift Taxi company aims to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour at airports to attract more drivers during peak hours. This project involves building a predictive model to forecast the number of orders using historical data. |
| 14 | Movie Review Sentiment Classification (ML for Texts) | This project focuses on building a model to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative, based on a dataset of IMDB reviews. |
| 15 | Age Verification (Computer Vision) | This project develops a deep learning model using computer vision techniques to estimate a person's age from facial images, helping a supermarket chain prevent underage alcohol sales. The model was trained and evaluated on GPU-accelerated platforms and validated through exploratory data analysis and performance metrics. |
| 16 | Telecom Churn Forecasting (Integrated Project) | The goal of this project was to forecast customer churn for a telecom operator, Interconnect. Churn prediction is critical for customer retention, as it allows the business to proactively target at-risk customers. This project involved cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, and training various machine learning models to predict customer churn. |
